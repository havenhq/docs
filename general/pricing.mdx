## Finetuning

The price of a finetuning run depends on the number of tokens in the training dataset. Below, you can find our prices for different models.



| Model | Token Pricing                           | 
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | 
| HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta     | $0.005 / 1K tokens    |
| meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf     | $0.005 / 1K tokens    |


If you train for multiple epochs, your token price will be multiplied by the number of training epochs. For instance, if you train on a dataset of 200,000 tokens for three epochs, the finetuning price will be 3$.
